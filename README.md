# XRC: Crosscutting Revision Control  #
The XRC approach improves the revision control (RC) support for aspect oriented programming (AOP). It features enrichment, persistence, comparison and display of crosscutting effects for this purpose.

The XRC plug-in implements the XRC approach as an Eclipse plug-in that extends the JDT, AJDT, and SVN plug-ins. The XRC plug-in provides crosscutting revision control (XRC) for developers that use the Subversion (SVN) revision control system and the aspectJ language.

The XRC architecture is flexible, and easy to adapt for other revision crontrol systems, and other meta-data.

The content of the folders is as following:

- **Docs** - User Guide and Developer Guide (currently can be found in the thesis appendixes).
- **EmbeddedInstallation** - Contains the required files for XRC plug-in installation within an already installed Eclipse IDE.
- **SvnRepository** - The SVN Repository contains the XRC Source Code, a Test Suite and the Bank Application examples updated at the release time.
- **GitRepository** - The GIT Repository will contain the XRC Source Code, a Test Suite and the Bank Application examples updated at the release time.

Note: The **XRC Standalone Installation** contains Eclipse with the XRC plug-in, as well as AJDT and SVN plug-ins. It is not commited to the github, however it is available on my sites:
